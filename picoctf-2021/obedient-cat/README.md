### Description
> This file has a flag in plain sight (aka "in-the-clear"). [Download flag](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/0e428b2db9788d31189329bed089ce98/flag).

### Hints
> Any hints about entering a command into the Terminal (such as the next one), will start with a '$'... everything after the dollar sign will be typed (or copy and pasted) into your Terminal.

> To get the file accessible in your shell, enter the following in the Terminal prompt: `$ wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/0e428b2db9788d31189329bed089ce98/flag`

> `$ man cat`

### My Process

I simply downloaded the provided file and used `cat flag` to print the flag out to the command line. 

Makes me wonder why this cat needs to be so obedient, and how my sanity can be verified if I've been losing it ever so slowly because of this CTF and **W I R E S H A R K .**

**Flag:** `picoCTF{s4n1ty_v3r1f13d_2fd6ed29}`
