### Description
> I have these 2 images, can you make a flag out of them? [scrambled1.png](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/e8054e22552c6aba591cdf7440eb25e4/scrambled1.png) [scrambled2.png](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/e8054e22552c6aba591cdf7440eb25e4/scrambled2.png)

### Hints

> Think of different ways you can "stack" images
